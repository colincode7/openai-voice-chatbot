## Web API
It uses [Stripe](https://stripe.com/) to provide payments infrastructure, so users can buy `bibs` - the API tokens. [Auth0](https://auth0.com/) is used to provide authentication and authorization. You can use them for free - Auth0 has a free tier up to 7000 users per month. Stripe only charges fees from purchases, so you have no ongoing costs from any of them.

If you want to use these services, you have to set up your Stripe and Auth0 accounts and put API keys into `.env` in `web-api/` directory.
